HeroToZero -- Hero Image Eliminator
===================================

Hero images are the scourge of modern web design, bloating pages and frustrating users with their gratuitous size and slow loading times.

Fight back with this plugin that destroys the largest image on the page, getting you to the real content much quicker.

You can choose a default mode, and override on a per-site basis, with persistent settings that sync across your devices.
