HeroToZero -- Hero Image Eliminator
===================================

Hero images are the scourge of modern web design, bloating pages and frustrating users with their gratuitous size and slow loading times.

Things are only getting worse these days when stock photos weren't bad enough, and now we get AI generated slop instead.

Fight back with this plugin that automatically hunts down and destroys the most obtrusive image upon page load, getting you to the real content much quicker.

Notable features:
* Choose a default behavior for all sites
* Override the behavior either way on a per-site basis
* Show a placeholder where the hero once was, which can be clicked to restore the image if needed.
* Coming Soon(TM) -- Adjust the sensitivity to be more lenient or more aggressive in the hunt.
